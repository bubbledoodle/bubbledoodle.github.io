## Something about me

Hi! I'm Shuaiyu Liang. People also call me Carl. I am an engineer, photographer, piano &amp; cat lover.

I graduated with a Masters in Electrical Engineering from [New York University](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical), 2017. At NYU, I have been a graduate assistant at High Speed Network lab working on NFV application development. I received my Bachelors in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn), in 2015, where my main focus was on signal processing and computer engineering.

I lost 50 lbs in the past two years. 

Recently I tried to get my life more engaged with networking. For a long time I kept my own paper notebooks and wrote everything down there and found it was a disaster when moving. I created this website and hopefully from now on this beautiful place will keep my new thinkings.
